            Committee for Community Service Program (CCSP) has launched since 2016 by a group of students at the American University of Phnom Penh. It started off from a club in AUPP. CCSP is a program that aims to improve Cambodian society through a
            variety of community services. As for the teaching program, we began by providing basic English education to a local primary school (Sakura Kbal Chroy Primary School) on the outskirt of the city. The teaching session took place every
            Saturday and lasts for the whole semester of primary school (12 months).

          <p id="ourStory" class="justify">
            After 1 academic year teaching and volunteering at Sakura Kbal Chroy Primary School which was such a great year at our beginning of CCSP, we have found another primary school in the suburb area of Phnom Penh and near to our university. We
            moved to the new primary school called Phnom Penh thmey primary school where there are a bigger school and a much larger amount of students from grades 1 to 6. Due to the small number of our volunteers, CCSP decided to teach only grade 6
            students which consist of 4 classes in each shift. It was a new start for second mandate of CCSP and everyone was ready to meet the new students.

            We considered Phnom Penh Thmey Primary school is our main teaching and volunteering location as we have a very good connection with the principle of the school. The priniciple was very pleased to have us (CCSP) here and he was also
            informing about the how great we are to the Ministry of Education as well. The ministry are fully support with what we are doing. Due the shortage of volunteer, we were still teaching grade 6 as we think that grade 6 is the last grade of
            primary school and we want our student to be ready for the new level of education which is highschool level. In 2018, we have taught about 400 students with about 30 volunteers from the students of AUPP.

            Everything was very exciting during the year of 2019. In 2019, we had about 50 volunteers and all of them were very hard-working, repsonsible and potential to our committee. The students as well were very intelligent, hard-working, and
            curious about learning. In 2019, we had visiting from the minsitry, from university administrator, and university student from United State. In that year, we hosted serveral workshops regarding educations, health and hygiene to our
            student.
            Those were such a wonderful moments we had in CCSP.

        With the new mandate, CCSP started to develop itself into modern learning along with technology. Our volunteers have our own classroom platform where they can take control of the student attendace and score very easily by using their smart
        device. We encourage our volunteer teachers to introduce technology to student by discussing about tech, science, and innovation to make our students have a modern mindset with the standard of the world nowadays. However, 2020 isn't a great
        year for everyone epsecailly the world. There is a crisis where there is a pandemic of Covid-19 which force everyone to stay protective. Due to this pandemic, Ministry of Education in Cambodia allowed all school and education institution
        across the country to take break and let students stay at home and be safe. Therefore; CCSP have taught only for serveral month and our volunteer was sad about this but in this circumstance we need to stay indoor. Fortunatey, our volunteer
        have come up with an E-learning program to children to learn English while they are staying at home. The program called "Learn English with CCSP". We gather the vocabularies from textbook and translate into khmer and post those vocabulaires
        on our social media platfrom such as Facebook and Instagram. We was hoping that children will reach to those vocabulaires through their parent and they will keep learning while they staying at home. Last but not least, we are planning to
        teach online as well. Please stay tuned with us.

      As part of AUPP learning curriculum, university wanted to provide us vibrant life at the campus and beside from learning and educating, they provide student a freedom to create their study club which can be related to any topic such as music,
      art, technology, sport, etc. A group senior in 2016 has come up with an idea of creating a community club where themselves and other students in AUPP can contribute their time to help the society. Therefore, that is why CCSP has began.</p>
